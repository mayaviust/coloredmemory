The css can get repetitive so I use sass. Don't worry about learning it.

Do look up basics for jQuery because using just javascript to grab elements is
hell.

***Don't feel obligated to learn all this in less than 24 hours. If it's too much
don't worry about it.

we're recording the time (to the milliseconds) of when matches are made by printing
to the console when two cards have been clicked, when the game starts, etc...

our memory game:
	need:
		timer
		max two cards shown at one time
		start button that flips all cards at once
		matching cards
	
	don't need:
		a way to shuffle cards
		restart
		
	more on the way
